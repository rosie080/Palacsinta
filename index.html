<p>Break the egg, add a pinch of salt and one teaspoon of sugar and beat until smooth.
Add some milk and some flour and mix well. I always add the ingredients gradually to avoid lumps.
When it is smooth, add the remaining flour, milk, and sparkling water. You can use still water with half a coffee-spoon baking soda.
The ideal pancake batter consistency is when the batter is not too runny and yet, not too stiff. It is like a thin yoghurt drink.
Put the pancake batter in the fridge for 5-10 minutes; meanwhile, make the sweet cottage cheese filling.
Separate an egg, you need only the yolk for this recipe. Beat the yolk with the sugar and vanilla until thick.
Put the cottage cheese in a bowl. Mash the cheese very well until it becomes absolutely soft. Now add the egg yolk and sugar mixture </p>
